# Scenario Description

The city of Stormford is a peacful city, being nestled in a lucious green valley bordered by steep mountain faces on each side, in addition to the natrual terrain that protects the town they are watched over by the Knights of Kalhtar  and led by a city council that offers represenation to the guilds, the nobles and the commoners. Unlike many of the other municpalitices in the area Stormford has beeen protected from the maurauding hordes, the arcane catastrophes and the political strife so common in the land. That was until the fall of Lord Suzarane. Have you heard the tell of Suzarane I thought not, it is not a story paladins would tell you. Szuarane was a noble man whose family was house was one of the original settlers of the valley that came to house Stormford, he was well beloved of the people, popular amongst the nobles, charitable to the poor, and a great support of the Holy Temple of Light setup to worship Ioun.

One day his only daughter, his pride and joy was struck down by a terrible illness. All the efforts of the physicians, all of the prayers of the clerics, and even the magics of the few mages that inhabited the area were of no use, the disease progressed rapidly. As the child lay there close too death Lord Suzarane  summoned the head clerics of the Temple of Light and demanded that they heal his duaghter, but alas as the clerics tried to explain the goddess had not given them the power to intervene in this case and had not responded to their prayers. Driven made by the refu sal of the clerics and the abandonment of the goddess to whom he had paid homage all his life, Lord Suzarane in a fit of rage drew his sword and slew both the clerics where they stood, then cried out in his anguish swearing that if there was any creature or power in all of the realms that could save his daughter from death him and all his household would give themselves to it. The agonzied cry reveberated through the planes and was heard by the powerful demon Melgathar.
Sensening an oportunity Melgathar appeared to Lord Alfred Suzarane promising that he would save his daughter from death, if he agreed to unconditionally give himself, his household, and his lands to Melgathar for all of eternity. Without thinking Suzarane swore the oath and in doing so bound himself and his people to a terrible suffering.

With the agreement made and the deal made Melgathar cursed all those under the lordship of Suzarane that their souls would be sealed to their bodies for all eternity, if they sufferred wounding to the point of death their souls would sit in torment until the stroke of midnight at which point their mortal frames would be restored to their former state, their souls being trapped forever in their bodies.

Using his new army of the damned Melgathar ordered them to go and raze Stormford to the ground; however he was not unoppossed. The goddess Ioun enraged by what had been done to her holy servants sent a message in dream to the Knights of Kalthar alterting them of what was transpiring. Thus even as the dark legion of Melgathar marched out of the keep of Lord Suzarane they were confronted by the paladins and knights of Kalthar. Terrible and glorious combat ensued that last all day and into the night. Although Stormford was a peaceful town that peace was purchased by large staffs of household guards kept by the nobles. As midnight came with the moon high in the sky, the Knights of Kalthar were on the verge of victory when they saw their previously slain foes begin to rise again to fight. Quickly they realized the futility of attempting to win through strength of arms, instead they sent forth their most able warriors and squires to the front to hold off the demon fueled horde as the paladins worked with the clerics of Ioun to attempt to overcome the curse. Unfortuantley their combined might could not undo the curse of a being as mighty as Melgathar but they were able to bend the curse and expand it&rsquo;s effects, they enahnced the curse so that it trapped not only the souls of the fallen but also bound their bodies to the grounds of the keeep of Suzarane, thus they trapped them within the confines of the keep and prevented the scourage from spreading to meance all the people of Stormford. Melgathar seeing his armies trapped and now useless to him abandoned control of those whom he had commanded leaving to forever be trapped in an endless loop of pain death and reanimation until time itself wore away.

However all is not well. The Knights of Kalthar must keep a constant seige upon the Keep of Suzarane which draws away resources that could be used elsewhere, the city council of Stormford is constantly anxious about the risk of the magical prison failing. Because of this great riches and honors have been offerred to any who can rid the city of the dark shadow of the Keep of Suzarane. Beyond the promise of riches that lure baser men the upper floors of the tower are said to also contain great hidden secrets of knowledge and power.

These temptations have lured many adventurers into the bowels of the keep in an attempt to discover how the curse may be undone, unfortunatley although many have entered few have returned and none have yet broken the dark magics that hold the town captive under the thrall of fear. Worse yet the curse appears to spread to those who fall within the halls of Keep Suzarene trapping their souls and bodies within it&rsquo;s halls. The constant cycle of death, pain and rebirth has driven many of hte inhabitants mad over the decades of suffering they have experienced turning them into vengeful, angry, hate filled abominations.

But now a neew band of adventurers has emerged determined to free the town once and for all, the only question is will they find fame and reknown by being the band to finally liberate Stormford, or will they be another in a long line of overconfident heroes doomed forever to an eternity of wandering the cursed halls of Keep Suzarene?
